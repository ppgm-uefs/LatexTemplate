   abstract = {Wireless sensor networks can be used to monitor and gather information from different environments, supporting a large set of applications that need constant monitoring. In some applications, the use of multiple mobile sinks can improve the network traffic and reduce energy consumption, leading to a higher network lifetime. Depending on the application characteristics, the priority of each sensor node can be considered in order to determine the positions of the mobile sinks, reducing the number of hops between high priority nodes and the sinks. We propose a QoE-aware multiple mobile sinks positioning approach aimed at the reduction of energy consumption in wireless sensor networks by shortening the distance of high priority nodes to the sinks. We believe that such approach can bring valuable results for sensing monitoring applications.},

   abstract = {The planning and deployment of a WSN (Wireless Sensor Network) in a Smart City can be a very challenging work. People involved in such implementation must be aware of how sensors and sinks may behave in the target environment. To aid the development of new WSNs, simulation tools are often used to predict how nodes will interact before spending time and money in a real deployment. Also, simulator can help students better understand WSNs. In this paper, we present MobSink, a simulator for WSNs with multiple mobile sinks. MobSink also allows to perform simulations in a Smart City scenario, with streets and movements constraints. It also shows how to configure MobSink for a generic scenario and describes how it works internally.},

   abstract = {Nowadays, the major cities of the world have to solve problems that were unthinkable in past decades. Due to the population growing rate, new issues are still arising, but technology can be used to address such issues and improve life quality in big cities. In that scenario, surveillance is a highly desired service and most governments are already using different types of devices to provide high levels of security. Wireless Visual Sensor Networks (WVSN) can be used to monitor every part of a city without the cost of running cables all over it. However, there must be an efficient way to gather all information collected by the sensors and cameras, with reduced energy consumption and average latency. This work proposes a new algorithm to position multiple mobile sinks in WVSN deployed along roads and streets. A relevance-based approach was designed to position sinks closer to source nodes with higher sensing relevance, since they are expected to transmit more data packets. The proposed algorithm can detect forbidden and disconnected zones, making sure sinks will be positioned in permitted areas, which makes this approach very suitable for realistic smart city applications.},

   abstract = {Modern cities are subject to periodic or unexpected critical events, which may bring economic losses or even put people in danger. When some monitoring systems based on wireless sensor networks are deployed, sensing and transmission configurations of sensor nodes may be adjusted exploiting the relevance of the considered events, but efficient detection and classification of events of interest may be hard to achieve. In Smart City environments, several people spontaneously post information in social media about some event that is being observed and such information may be mined and processed for detection and classification of critical events. This article proposes an integrated approach to detect and classify events of interest posted in social media, notably in Twitter, and the assignment of sensing priorities to source nodes. By doing so, wireless sensor networks deployed in Smart City scenarios can be optimized for higher efficiency when monitoring areas under the influence of the detected events.},
